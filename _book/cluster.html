<p>The data pre-processing involves two main steps:
- remove variables with near zero variance

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> K-means Clustering</h2>
<p>This type of Clustering involves minimizing the within cluster variation. Hartigan and Wong(1979) provided the following algorithm for K-means Clustering</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[W(C_k) =  \sum_{x_1 \in C_k}(x_i-μ_k)^2\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> is a data point in cluster <span class="math inline">\(C_k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(μ_k\)</span> is the mean of all values in cluster <span class="math inline">\(C_k\)</span>.To put it simply, <em>Clustering</em> is an optimization algorithm which and <em>k-means</em> is one variant which tries to build coherent clusters that minimize within cluster dissimilarity.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> How to specify the number of clusters?</h3>
<p>One of the important questions across dimension reduction techniques involves how many dimensions are the most optimal to describe the data at hand. This is essentially what we intend to do when we want to identify the groups in the data given the features. In our case the features involve the use variables in the World Value Survey.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Method WSS</strong>: The within cluster dispersion of data, also know as the <em>error measure</em>, is likely to drop more prominently after some clustering value. This creates a “elbow” like visual on the plot which is utilized to indicate the optimal number of clusters to model the data.</li>

<li><strong>Method: Silhoutte</strong>: This method determines the appropriateness of a data point in a cluster. In other words, it computes how similar an observation is to a given cluster as compared to neighboring clusters.
It computes average silhoutte of observations for varying <em>k</em> values. the <em>k</em> configuration is dependent on the values assigned to the observations across clusters, if these values are high the <em>k</em> or the number of clusters is seen as the appropriate value for structuring the data.</li>

<p>As you can see in the plot above, the WSS drop as the number of clusters increase. It keeps dropping even when the cluster size is 40. The graph indicates that the between cluster variance does not increase by much after <em>k</em> = 35. We can consider this as an approximate of the value of optimal <em>k</em> for the data.</p>
